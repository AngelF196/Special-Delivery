# Final Project
## Check-in
### Angel's Devlog
At this point, I have written the code for the player’s movement, and although it is not finished I think that it has progressed smoothly and is very close to completion. I split the movement into two scripts, one dealing with normal and basic movement, and one dealing with the player’s dashes and dives. I’ve made multiple variables that are easily changeable for tweaking like the player’s “_horizontalSpeed”, “_maxFallSpeed”, “_dashPower”, and many others. This allows for simple player experimentation in the editor. There’s still a lot of work to be done in the engine and the code. I still need to make a tilemap for easy level building, an animation tree for the player for when we make the sprites, and implement audio into the game. The player is the only fleshed-out game object and even then it lacks any animation or sprites. As much work as the player still needs, there are also many other prefabs that I need to make and mechanics to implement. I plan to implement conveyor belts, springs, proper jumps, particle effects, and some other things as said in the proposal. Speaking of the proposal, I think it has helped in breaking down the project into steps, very similar to the breakdowns from the earlier homework assignments. Unfortunately, due to the open-ended nature of this assignment, the proposal wasn’t as detailed as previous breakdowns. I had to work out the logistics on how to implement the mechanics that I mentioned in the proposal and the movement code has taken up most of my time due to how much more complicated I expected it to be. Overall, I expect most tasks after the movement to be fairly simple to implement. We’ve been using a Google doc with the tasks outlined and have been marking what tasks have been done, what still needs to be started, and the priority of all the tasks. I think the game was a bit too ambitious at the beginning and we’ve been struggling a bit to reach our expectations. However, it is definitely possible and we’re working on it. I think in the future we’ll be a bit more mindful of the scope of our projects and give more detailed steps to take to implement what we set out to do. Overall, I’m optimistic that we’ll be able to make this game shape our vision.
